# REAL-TIME STOCK PREDICTION

## The Algorithms

Our team used some Machine Learning algorithms such as <strong>Linear Regression</strong>, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (<strong>ARIMA</strong>) and Long short-term memory (<strong>LSTM</strong>) to build a website to display and predict stock prices in real time.

## The technologies

The technology our team uses is Node.js (BackEnd) and React (FrontEnd). We found that Node.js is a very suitable platform for deploying Realtime applications and that's why we chose the Node.js platform. On the front-end side, we chose to use the React framework to make API calls and display relevant information and forecast results.
