# REAL-TIME STOCK PREDICTION

## The Algorithms

Our team used some Machine Learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Long short-term memory (LSTM) to build a website to display and predict stock prices in real time.

## The technologies

The technology our team uses is Node.js (BackEnd) and React (FrontEnd). We found that Node.js is a very suitable platform for deploying Realtime applications and that's why we chose the Node.js platform. On the front-end side, we chose to use the React framework to make API calls and display relevant information and forecast results.
